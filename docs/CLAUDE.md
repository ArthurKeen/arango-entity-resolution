# Claude AI Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines how Claude AI is integrated into the ArangoDB Entity Resolution with Record Blocking project to assist with development, research, and optimization tasks.

## Use Cases

### 1. Algorithm Research and Implementation
- **Literature Review**: Claude helps analyze and summarize academic papers on entity resolution
- **Algorithm Selection**: Assists in choosing appropriate similarity metrics and blocking strategies
- **Code Review**: Provides feedback on algorithm implementations and optimizations

### 2. Data Quality Analysis
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common data quality issues in datasets
- **Preprocessing Recommendations**: Suggests data cleaning and normalization strategies
- **Schema Design**: Helps design optimal ArangoDB schemas for entity resolution

### 3. Configuration Optimization
- **Parameter Tuning**: Assists in optimizing blocking keys and similarity thresholds
- **Performance Analysis**: Helps interpret performance metrics and suggest improvements
- **Scalability Planning**: Provides guidance on horizontal scaling strategies

### 4. Documentation and Testing
- **Code Documentation**: Generates comprehensive documentation for complex algorithms
- **Test Case Generation**: Creates diverse test scenarios for entity matching
- **API Documentation**: Assists in maintaining clear API specifications

## Integration Patterns

### Research Assistant
```
Context: "I'm implementing a new blocking strategy for customer records..."
Claude Role: Provides relevant academic references, algorithm suggestions, and implementation guidance
```

### Code Review Partner
```
Context: "Review this similarity function for performance and accuracy..."
Claude Role: Analyzes code quality, suggests optimizations, identifies edge cases
```

### Architecture Consultant
```
Context: "How should we design the ArangoDB schema for this entity resolution pipeline?"
Claude Role: Provides schema recommendations, query optimization tips, scalability considerations
```

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Context**: Always include relevant project background and specific requirements
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Use Claude for iterative improvement of algorithms and code
3. **Cross-Validation**: Validate Claude's suggestions against academic literature and testing
4. **Domain Expertise**: Leverage Claude's knowledge of both computer science and domain-specific entity resolution challenges

## Project-Specific Prompts

### For Algorithm Development
```
"Given the requirements in our PRD, suggest an optimal blocking strategy for customer records with these attributes: [list attributes]. Consider performance with millions of records."
```

### For Performance Optimization
```
"Analyze this AQL query for entity matching. The dataset has [size] records. Suggest optimizations for better performance while maintaining accuracy."
```

### For Research Integration
```
"Summarize the key findings from [paper title] and explain how they apply to our ArangoDB-based entity resolution system."
```

## Limitations and Considerations

- Claude's knowledge has a training cutoff date - verify recent research independently
- Always test Claude's suggestions thoroughly before production implementation
- Use Claude as a collaborative tool, not a replacement for domain expertise
- Maintain human oversight for critical system design decisions
