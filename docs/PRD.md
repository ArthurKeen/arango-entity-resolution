# Entity Resolution with Record Blocking - Product Requirements Document

Entity resolution is a process that identifies and links records from one or more data sources that refer to the same real-world entity (e.g., person, company, product). The record blocking technique is a crucial first step that improves efficiency by reducing the number of record pairs that need to be compared.

Here is a PRD template for an entity resolution project in ArangoDB using the record blocking technique. 

### 1. Project Overview

* **Project Title:** ArangoDB Entity Resolution with Record Blocking
* **Problem Statement:** Our organization has multiple data sources with customer information. These sources contain duplicate records for the same customer due to variations in data entry, spelling errors, and missing information. This leads to inaccurate analytics, poor customer service, and inefficient operations.
* **Project Goal:** Implement an entity resolution system in ArangoDB to deduplicate and link customer records from various sources, providing a single, unified view of each customer. This will improve data quality and enable more accurate reporting and personalized customer interactions.

### 2. Stakeholders

* **Product Manager:** Manages the product roadmap and requirements.
* **Data Engineers:** Responsible for the implementation and maintenance of the ArangoDB solution.
* **Data Analysts:** End-users who will use the unified data for reporting and insights.
* **Business Leaders:** Benefit from improved data quality and business intelligence.

### 3. Functional Requirements

* **Data Ingestion:** The system must be able to import customer data from various sources (e.g., CSV files, external APIs) into ArangoDB collections.
* **Blocking Key Generation:** The system must generate a blocking key for each record. This key will be a combination of one or more attributes (e.g., first letter of the last name and the city) used to group similar records. The logic for key generation should be configurable.
* **Record Blocking:** The system must use the generated blocking keys to create "blocks" of candidate records. A block is a group of records that share the same blocking key. This is a crucial step to reduce the number of pairwise comparisons.
* **Pairwise Comparison:** Within each block, the system must compare all records to each other using a configurable similarity metric (e.g., Jaro-Winkler for names, exact match for phone numbers).
* **Scoring and Matching:** The system must generate a similarity score for each record pair based on the attribute comparisons. Records with a similarity score above a predefined threshold will be considered a match.
* **Clustering:** The system must group matched records into clusters. Each cluster represents a single, resolved entity.
* **Golden Record Creation:** The system must be able to create a "golden record" for each cluster, which is the most accurate and complete representation of the entity. This can be done using a configurable rule-based approach (e.g., using the most recent or complete record).
* **REST API:** The system must expose a REST API to trigger the entity resolution process and retrieve the results.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** The blocking and matching process should be scalable to handle millions of records. The system should complete the resolution of a dataset within a specified time frame.
* **Scalability:** The architecture must be designed to scale horizontally by adding more ArangoDB servers as the data volume increases.
* **Security:** Access to the ArangoDB database and the REST API must be secured with proper authentication and authorization.
* **Maintainability:** The code should be well-documented and modular to allow for future enhancements and bug fixes.

## Best Papers on Entity Resolution and Record Blocking

Academic research in entity resolution is vast, but here are some of the most influential papers and surveys that provide a strong foundation on record blocking and related techniques.

1.  **"A Survey of Blocking and Filtering Techniques for Entity Resolution"** by George Papadakis et al.: This is a comprehensive and modern survey that categorizes and reviews a wide range of blocking and filtering methods. It's a great starting point for understanding the different blocking techniques and their trade-offs.
2.  **"The Dedoop Framework for Scalable Entity Resolution"** by S. E. K. M. A. KÃ¶pcke and A. Thor: This paper presents a framework for scalable entity resolution, which includes a detailed discussion of blocking and other techniques in a distributed computing context.
3.  **"Probabilistic Models of Record Linkage and Deduplication"** by A. E. M. L. Fellegi and A. B. Sunter: Often considered the foundational paper in probabilistic record linkage, this work introduces the Fellegi-Sunter model. While not exclusively about blocking, it provides the theoretical underpinnings for scoring and matching records, which is the subsequent step after blocking.
4.  **"A Comparative Analysis of Approximate Blocking Techniques for Entity Resolution"** by George Papadakis et al.: This paper provides a practical comparison of various blocking methods, evaluating their performance and scalability on different datasets. It's an excellent resource for anyone looking to implement a blocking strategy.
5.  **"Magellan: Toward Building Entity Matching Management Systems"** by AnHai Doan et al.: This paper discusses the challenges and solutions for building end-to-end entity matching systems. It emphasizes the importance of a complete pipeline, including data cleaning, blocking, and matching.
