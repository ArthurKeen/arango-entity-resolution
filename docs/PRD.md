# Advanced Entity Resolution System - Product Requirements Document

Entity resolution is a process that identifies and links records from one or more data sources that refer to the same real-world entity (e.g., person, company, product). This system implements a comprehensive, multi-stage approach combining traditional techniques with cutting-edge AI/ML methods.

This PRD outlines the requirements for an advanced entity resolution system in ArangoDB that leverages multiple techniques: record blocking (foundation), graph algorithms, embeddings, vector search, GraphRAG, geospatial analysis, and LLM-based curation. 

### 1. Project Overview

* **Project Title:** ArangoDB Advanced Entity Resolution System
* **Problem Statement:** Our organization has multiple data sources with customer information (structured databases, unstructured documents, and spatial-temporal data). These sources contain duplicate records, hidden aliases, and complex entity relationships that are difficult to identify using traditional methods alone. This leads to inaccurate analytics, poor customer service, missed fraud detection, and inefficient operations.
* **Project Goal:** Implement a comprehensive entity resolution system in ArangoDB that combines multiple techniques:
  - **Record Blocking** (foundation): Efficiently reduce comparison space using full-text search
  - **Graph Algorithms**: Discover entity networks and aliases through shared identifiers
  - **Embeddings & Vector Search**: Identify semantically similar entities through behavioral patterns
  - **GraphRAG & LLMs**: Extract and link entities from unstructured documents
  - **Geospatial Analysis**: Validate or reject matches based on location-time feasibility
  - **LLM Curation**: Automated evaluation of match evidence with human-like reasoning
  
  This multi-faceted approach will provide a single, unified view of each entity with high confidence, improving data quality and enabling more accurate reporting, fraud detection, and personalized interactions.

### 2. Stakeholders

* **Product Manager:** Manages the product roadmap and requirements.
* **Data Engineers:** Responsible for the implementation and maintenance of the ArangoDB solution.
* **Data Analysts:** End-users who will use the unified data for reporting and insights.
* **Business Leaders:** Benefit from improved data quality and business intelligence.

### 3. Functional Requirements

#### **3.1 Foundation: Traditional Entity Resolution (Implemented)**

* **Data Ingestion:** Import customer data from various sources (CSV files, JSON, external APIs, databases) into ArangoDB collections
* **Traditional Record Blocking:** Generate blocking keys using multiple strategies (exact, phonetic, n-gram, sorted neighborhood) to create candidate pairs with 99%+ reduction in comparisons
* **Hybrid Blocking (Phase 3):** Combine traditional blocking with embedding-based candidate generation:
  - **Tier 1**: Exact matching on email/phone (fastest, highest precision)
  - **Tier 2**: Traditional fuzzy blocking with soundex, n-grams (fast, good recall)
  - **Tier 3**: Embedding-based semantic blocking with LSH and ANN (comprehensive, handles variations)
  - **Multi-Resolution Embeddings**: Store both coarse embeddings (64-dim) for fast filtering and fine embeddings (256-dim) for accurate re-ranking
  - **Recall-Optimized**: Prioritize recall ≥95% at blocking stage, refine precision in later stages
* **Pairwise Comparison:** Compare records within blocks using configurable similarity metrics (Jaro-Winkler, Levenshtein, Jaccard)
* **Scoring and Matching:** Generate similarity scores using Fellegi-Sunter probabilistic framework
* **Graph-Based Clustering:** Use Weakly Connected Components algorithm to group matched records

#### **3.2 Advanced Capabilities (Roadmap)**

**Graph Algorithm Analysis**
* **Shared Identifier Detection:** Identify entities connected through common phone numbers, emails, or addresses

* **Network Metrics:** Calculate centrality, betweenness, and other graph metrics for entities
* **Community Detection:** Apply advanced clustering algorithms for entity grouping

**Embedding & Vector Search**
* **Tuple Embeddings for Structured Data:** Generate embeddings specifically designed for database records using hybrid architecture (attribute-level + tuple-level)

* **Siamese Networks:** Train models specifically for similarity learning with contrastive loss
* **Multi-Resolution Embeddings:** Generate both coarse (64-dim) and fine (256-dim) embeddings for two-stage blocking
* **LSH Indexing:** Use Locality-Sensitive Hashing for fast coarse filtering of candidates
* **HNSW/ANN Indexing:** Implement Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs for accurate fine-grained search
* **GraphML Integration:** Generate node embeddings capturing structural properties of entity graphs
* **Behavioral Embeddings:** Create vector representations of entity behavior patterns
* **Vector Storage:** Store embeddings efficiently in ArangoDB with version control
* **Vector Similarity Search:** ArangoDB native vector search with cosine similarity
* **Multi-Modal Embeddings:** Combine text, graph, and behavioral embeddings
* **Transfer Learning:** Pre-train on general ER datasets, fine-tune on domain-specific data

**GraphRAG & LLM Integration**
* **Document Entity Extraction:** Use LLMs to extract entities from unstructured documents
* **Entity Embedding Generation:** Create semantic embeddings for extracted entities
* **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Build entity knowledge graphs from document collections
* **Semantic Entity Linking:** Link extracted entities to existing records via embedding similarity
* **LLM-Based Curation:** Use LLMs to evaluate match evidence and make final resolution decisions
* **Explainable AI:** Provide reasoning for LLM-based entity resolution decisions

**Geospatial-Temporal Analysis**
* **Location Data Ingestion:** Import and store geospatial data (GeoJSON) for entities
* **Temporal Data Management:** Track entity locations over time
* **Co-Location Analysis:** Determine if entities are at same place at same time
* **Spatial Impossibility Detection:** Reject matches for entities proven to be in different locations simultaneously
* **Movement Pattern Analysis:** Analyze entity trajectories for behavior-based matching
* **Geofencing:** Define spatial boundaries for entity validation

**Integrated Evidence Aggregation**
* **Multi-Technique Scoring:** Aggregate evidence from blocking, graph, embeddings, geospatial, and LLM sources
* **Confidence Weighting:** Assign confidence scores to each technique's contribution
* **Ensemble Decision Making:** Combine multiple signals for final entity resolution
* **Conflict Resolution:** Handle disagreements between different techniques
* **Audit Trail:** Track which techniques contributed to each resolution decision

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** The blocking and matching process should be scalable to handle millions of records. The system should complete the resolution of a dataset within a specified time frame.
* **Scalability:** The architecture must be designed to scale horizontally by adding more ArangoDB servers as the data volume increases.
* **Security:** Access to the ArangoDB database and the REST API must be secured with proper authentication and authorization.
* **Maintainability:** The code should be well-documented and modular to allow for future enhancements and bug fixes.
