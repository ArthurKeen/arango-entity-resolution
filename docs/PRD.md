# Advanced Entity Resolution System - Product Requirements Document

Entity resolution is a process that identifies and links records from one or more data sources that refer to the same real-world entity (e.g., person, company, product). This system implements a comprehensive, multi-stage approach combining traditional techniques with cutting-edge AI/ML methods.

This PRD outlines the requirements for an advanced entity resolution system in ArangoDB that leverages multiple techniques: record blocking (foundation), graph algorithms, embeddings, vector search, GraphRAG, geospatial analysis, and LLM-based curation. 

### 1. Project Overview

* **Project Title:** ArangoDB Advanced Entity Resolution System
* **Problem Statement:** Our organization has multiple data sources with customer information (structured databases, unstructured documents, and spatial-temporal data). These sources contain duplicate records, hidden aliases, and complex entity relationships that are difficult to identify using traditional methods alone. This leads to inaccurate analytics, poor customer service, missed fraud detection, and inefficient operations.
* **Project Goal:** Implement a comprehensive entity resolution system in ArangoDB that combines multiple techniques:
  - **Record Blocking** (foundation): Efficiently reduce comparison space using full-text search
  - **Graph Algorithms**: Discover entity networks and aliases through shared identifiers
  - **Embeddings & Vector Search**: Identify semantically similar entities through behavioral patterns
  - **GraphRAG & LLMs**: Extract and link entities from unstructured documents
  - **Geospatial Analysis**: Validate or reject matches based on location-time feasibility
  - **LLM Curation**: Automated evaluation of match evidence with human-like reasoning
  
  This multi-faceted approach will provide a single, unified view of each entity with high confidence, improving data quality and enabling more accurate reporting, fraud detection, and personalized interactions.

### 2. Stakeholders

* **Product Manager:** Manages the product roadmap and requirements.
* **Data Engineers:** Responsible for the implementation and maintenance of the ArangoDB solution.
* **Data Analysts:** End-users who will use the unified data for reporting and insights.
* **Business Leaders:** Benefit from improved data quality and business intelligence.

### 2.1 Development Phases

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** The blocking and matching process should be scalable to handle millions of records. The system should complete the resolution of a dataset within a specified time frame.
* **Scalability:** The architecture must be designed to scale horizontally by adding more ArangoDB servers as the data volume increases.
* **Security:** Access to the ArangoDB database and the REST API must be secured with proper authentication and authorization.
* **Maintainability:** The code should be well-documented and modular to allow for future enhancements and bug fixes.
