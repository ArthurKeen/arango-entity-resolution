# Neo4j Movie Dataset - Clarification

## Important: No Neo4j Movie Dataset in This Project

**There is currently NO Neo4j movie dataset implementation in this codebase.**

The entity resolution system is designed specifically for **business customer data**, not entertainment industry data.

## What You Might Be Thinking Of

You may be referring to:

1. **Neo4j's Famous Movie Database**: The classic Neo4j tutorial dataset with actors, directors, and films
2. **Graph Database Comparisons**: References to Neo4j in our documentation as a comparison point
3. **ArangoDB's Multi-Model Approach**: Our system can handle graph data like Neo4j's movie dataset, but we focus on customer entity resolution

## What IS Actually Implemented

### **Customer Entity Resolution Dataset**
- **Real-world business focus**: Customer deduplication and master data management
- **Synthetic business data**: Realistic customer records with common data quality issues
- **Enterprise use cases**: CRM deduplication, customer 360, data quality improvement

### **Available Demo Datasets**
1. **Sample Customer Data**: 10 customer records with duplicates for quick testing
2. **Generated Demo Data**: 1K-50K customer records for presentations
3. **Industry Scenarios**: B2B Sales, E-commerce, Healthcare, Financial Services

## How to Test the ACTUAL Implemented Datasets

### **Quick Test - Customer Entity Resolution**
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /Users/arthurkeen/code/arango-entity-resolution-record-blocking

# Test with existing customer sample data
python examples/complete_entity_resolution_demo.py
```

### **Interactive Demo - Business Scenarios**
```bash
# Launch interactive demo system
python demo/launch_presentation_demo.py

# Choose option 1: Interactive Presentation Demo
```

### **Generate Large Test Dataset**
```bash
# Generate 10,000 customer records with 20% duplication
cd demo/scripts
python data_generator.py --records 10000 --duplicate-rate 0.2 --output-dir ../data

# Run demo with generated data
python demo_orchestrator.py --records 10000
```

## Why No Movie Dataset?

This entity resolution system is designed for **enterprise business applications**:

- **Customer Master Data Management (MDM)**
- **CRM data deduplication**
- **Marketing campaign optimization**
- **Sales lead management**
- **Compliance and data governance**

The Neo4j movie dataset, while great for learning graph concepts, doesn't address these real-world business challenges.

## Could We Add a Movie Dataset?

If you specifically need a movie dataset for educational or demonstration purposes, it would be possible to:

1. **Import Neo4j movie data** into ArangoDB
2. **Adapt entity resolution** for actor/director deduplication
3. **Create movie-specific blocking strategies** (name variations, aliases, etc.)

However, this would be a **new implementation** and would require:
- Data import scripts
- Movie-specific similarity metrics
- Entertainment industry blocking strategies
- Different demo scenarios

## Next Steps

If you want to test the entity resolution system:

1. **Use the existing customer datasets** (already implemented and tested)
2. **Run the interactive demos** (designed for business presentations)
3. **Generate custom business data** (using the data generator)

If you specifically need a movie dataset:
1. This would be a new feature request
2. Would require significant implementation work
3. Should be prioritized against business-focused improvements

The current system provides powerful, production-ready entity resolution for real business use cases - which is typically much more valuable than academic movie data for actual enterprise deployments.
