   - Actual unique: ~8,000 (2,000 duplicates)
   - **Business Impact**: "You're losing 20% efficiency in every customer operation"

3. **Show Specific Examples**:
   - Same customer with 3 different email addresses
   - CEO listed as both "John Smith" and "J. Smith" 
   - Company appearing as "Microsoft", "Microsoft Corp", "MSFT"

**"AI-Powered Entity Resolution in Action"**

1. **Configure the System** (30 seconds):
   - Show configuration options (similarity thresholds, field weights)
   - Explain blocking strategies for performance

2. **Run Entity Resolution** (Live):
   - Execute the complete pipeline
   - Show real-time progress and performance metrics
   - **Result**: Process 10,000 records in under 10 seconds

3. **Demonstrate Results**:
   - **Similarity Analysis**: Show how "John Smith" matches "J. Smith" (95% confidence)
   - **Blocking Efficiency**: "Reduced 50M comparisons to 50K (99.9% efficiency)"
   - **Golden Records**: Show consolidated master records

### Act 3: Business Value (10 minutes)
**"Measuring the Impact"**

1. **Before/After Comparison**:
   - Duplicate customers: 2,000 → 0
   - Data completeness: 60% → 95%
   - Marketing reach: +20% (no duplicate sends)
   - Customer service efficiency: +30% (unified view)

2. **ROI Calculation**:
   - "For a 100K customer database:"
   - Duplicate marketing costs saved: $50K/year
   - Customer service efficiency: $200K/year
   - Revenue recovery from better targeting: $500K/year
   - **Total ROI**: 750% in first year

3. **Technical Excellence**:
