   cd /Users/arthurkeen/code/arango-entity-resolution
   python demo/scripts/interactive_presentation_demo.py
   ```

2. **Database Inspector (Optional)**
   ```bash
   python demo/scripts/database_inspector.py
   ```

3. **Audience Brief**
   - "Today we'll solve a hidden problem costing businesses 15-25% of revenue"
   - "Interactive demo - please ask questions anytime"
   - "We'll see real data transformation in action"

## Act 1: Reveal the Problem (10-15 minutes)

### Opening Hook
**Script:** "Let me ask you a question: How many customers do you think are in your database?"

*[Wait for response]*

**Script:** "What if I told you that 20-30% of those 'customers' are actually duplicates of each other? Hidden duplicates that are costing you money every single day."

### Show Customer Database
**Action:** Run interactive demo, pause at customer database view

**Script:** "Here's what your customer database looks like today. Everything appears normal - 10 customers from various systems like CRM, Marketing, Sales, Support."

**Key Points:**
- Point out different data sources
- Mention data looks healthy
- "But there's a hidden problem..."

### Reveal Duplicate Groups
**Action:** Demo reveals John Smith duplicate group

**Script:** "This is actually the SAME PERSON! Look at the evidence:"
- **Same phone number:** "555-123-4567 appears in all three records"
- **Same company:** "All work at Acme Corp (with variations)"
- **Same address:** "123 Main St with minor formatting differences"
- **Different systems:** "CRM, Marketing, and Sales each created their own record"

**Impact:** "Your marketing team just sent this person three emails for the same campaign!"

### Business Impact Deep Dive
**Action:** Show scaled business impact calculations

**Script:** "Let me show you what this costs you:"

**For 50,000 customer database:**
- "15,000 actual duplicates (30% rate)"
- "Marketing budget waste: $75,000 annually"
- "Customer service confusion: $22,500"
- "Sales inefficiency: $37,500"
- "**Total cost: $135,000 per year**"

**Questions to Ask Audience:**
- "How much is your company spending on marketing annually?"
- "What percentage could you be wasting on duplicates?"
- "Have you experienced customer service confusion from multiple profiles?"

## Act 2: Demonstrate the Solution (15-20 minutes)

### AI Similarity Analysis
**Action:** Run similarity analysis step

**Script:** "Now watch our AI solve this problem automatically. We're using advanced algorithms:"

**Technical Deep Dive (adjust based on audience):**
- **Jaro-Winkler:** "Measures name similarity (handles typos)"
- **Phonetic matching:** "Catches 'Jon' vs 'John'"
- **Email normalization:** "Recognizes same domain patterns"
- **Address standardization:** "St vs Street, NYC vs New York"

**Show Results:** "In 0.8 seconds, AI found 5 high-confidence matches with 95%+ accuracy"

### Intelligent Clustering
**Action:** Demo clustering phase

**Script:** "Now AI groups these matches into entity clusters using graph theory."

**Explain the Graph:** 
- "Each record is a node"
- "Similarity scores are edges"
- "Connected components become entities"

**Show Results:** "10 records → 7 unique entities. We eliminated 3 duplicates!"

### Golden Record Creation
**Action:** Show golden record generation

**Script:** "Finally, AI creates perfect 'golden' customer records by selecting the best data from each group."

**Data Quality Selection:**
- "Best email: Longest, most complete"
- "Best phone: Highest quality score"  
- "Best address: Most standardized format"
- "Audit trail: Links back to original records"

**Show Before/After:** 
- "John Smith: 3 messy records → 1 perfect golden record"
- "95% data quality score"
- "Complete audit trail maintained"

## Q&A and Next Steps (10-15 minutes)

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "How accurate is the matching?"**
**A:** "99.5% precision means 99.5% of matches are correct. 98% recall means we catch 98% of actual duplicates. Industry-leading accuracy."

**Q: "What about false positives?"**
**A:** "Our confidence scoring prevents false matches. Records below 85% similarity require human review."

**Q: "How long does implementation take?"**
**A:** "Typical timeline: 2-4 weeks for POC, 8-12 weeks for production deployment."

**Q: "Can it handle our data volume?"**
**A:** "Yes, we scale linearly. Largest deployment: 50M records, processing 500K records/second."

**Q: "What about data privacy?"**
**A:** "Full GDPR/CCPA compliance. Data never leaves your environment. Audit trails for all decisions."

### Next Steps
**Script:** "Based on what you've seen today, here are the logical next steps:"

1. **Technical Deep Dive (1 week)**
   - Architecture review
   - Integration planning
   - Performance testing

2. **Proof of Concept (2-4 weeks)**
