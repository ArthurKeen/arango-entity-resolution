## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Use Shared Utilities**: Import from scripts/shared_utils.py to avoid duplication
2. **Configuration Management**: Use constants from src/entity_resolution/utils/constants.py
3. **Test Organization**: Keep all tests in scripts/tests/ directory
4. **Code Review**: Regular code quality audits to prevent accumulation of issues

## Files Created
- scripts/shared_utils.py - Shared utilities to eliminate duplication
- scripts/consolidated_test_suite.py - Comprehensive test suite
- scripts/tests/ - Directory for organized test files

## Files Removed
- Multiple backup files
- Duplicate test files
- Redundant utility files
