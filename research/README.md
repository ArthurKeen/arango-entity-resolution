## Research Workflow

1. **Paper Collection**: Gather relevant academic papers in `papers/` directory
2. **Analysis**: Create summary notes for each paper in `notes/`
3. **Implementation**: Extract actionable insights for the project
4. **Validation**: Test research findings against project requirements

## Contributing Research

When adding new research materials:
- Use consistent naming convention: `YYYY_AuthorLastName_ShortTitle.pdf`
