**Authors**: George Papadakis, Odysseas Papapetrou, Themis Palpanas, Manolis Koubarakis

**Publication**: Comprehensive survey paper on blocking techniques

**Relevance to Project**: (Core Foundation)

## Abstract Summary

This comprehensive survey categorizes and reviews a wide range of blocking and filtering methods for entity resolution. It provides an excellent starting point for understanding different blocking techniques and their trade-offs, which is fundamental to our ArangoDB implementation.

## Key Concepts

### Blocking Fundamentals
- **Purpose**: Reduce the quadratic complexity of pairwise comparisons
- **Principle**: Group similar records into blocks for comparison
- **Challenge**: Balance efficiency with recall (don't miss true matches)

### Blocking Techniques Covered
1. **Traditional Blocking**
 - Standard blocking with exact key matching
 - Sorted neighborhood method
 - Canopy clustering

2. **Advanced Blocking**
 - Q-gram based blocking
 - Suffix array blocking
 - LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing)

3. **Meta-blocking**
 - Block filtering techniques
 - Block processing strategies
 - Redundancy elimination

## Relevant Findings for Our Project

### For ArangoDB Implementation
- **Graph-based blocking**: Can leverage ArangoDB's graph capabilities
- **Composite keys**: Multiple blocking keys per record (matches our sample data)
- **Schema-agnostic approaches**: Important for heterogeneous data sources

### Performance Considerations
- **Reduction Ratio**: Percentage of comparisons eliminated
- **Pairs Completeness**: Percentage of true matches preserved
- **Block size distribution**: Impact on processing efficiency

### Recommended Approaches
1. **Multi-pass blocking**: Use multiple blocking strategies
2. **Phonetic blocking**: For name variations (relevant to customer data)
3. **Hybrid methods**: Combine exact and approximate blocking

## Implementation Implications

### For Our Blocking Key Strategy
```python
# Example blocking keys from paper concepts:
blocking_keys = {
 'phonetic': soundex(last_name) + first_name[0],
 'geographic': city[:3] + state,
 'identifier': phone[-4:] if phone else email.split('@')[0][:3]
}
```

### For ArangoDB Schema
- Store multiple blocking keys per record
- Index blocking keys for efficient retrieval
- Support dynamic blocking key generation

## Trade-offs Identified

| Method | Efficiency | Recall | Implementation Complexity |
|--------|------------|--------|---------------------------|
| Standard Blocking | High | Medium | Low |
| Q-gram Blocking | Medium | High | Medium |
| LSH | High | Medium | High |
| Meta-blocking | Very High | Medium | High |

## Evaluation Metrics from Paper

### Quality Metrics
- **Precision**: True matches / All identified matches
- **Recall**: True matches / All actual matches 
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Reduction Ratio**: (Total pairs - Candidate pairs) / Total pairs
- **Pairs Completeness**: Candidate matches / Total matches

## Action Items for Implementation

1. **Implement Standard Blocking First**: Start with simple exact key matching
2. **Add Phonetic Blocking**: For handling name variations in customer data
3. **Support Multiple Keys**: Allow records to belong to multiple blocks
4. **Measure Performance**: Track reduction ratio and pairs completeness
5. **Iterate Based on Results**: Add more sophisticated methods as needed

## Connections to Other Papers

- **Links to Fellegi-Sunter**: Provides scoring framework for candidate pairs
- **Connects to Comparative Analysis**: More detailed comparison of specific techniques
- **Supports Magellan**: End-to-end system design principles

## Research Status

- [ ] **Full Paper Access**: Need to obtain complete paper for detailed algorithms
- [x] **Core Concepts**: Understood from survey summaries

## Next Steps

1. Implement basic blocking in our ArangoDB schema
2. Test with our sample customer data
3. Compare different blocking strategies
4. Optimize based on paper recommendations
