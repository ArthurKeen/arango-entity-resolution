## Access Notes

Due to copyright restrictions, PDF files of academic papers are not included in this repository. However, we provide:
- Complete bibliographic information
- Abstract summaries
- Key findings relevant to our project
- Links to official sources where available

## Contributing Research

When adding new papers:
1. Follow the established naming convention
