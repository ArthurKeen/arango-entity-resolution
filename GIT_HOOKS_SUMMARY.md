# Git Hooks Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

A pre-commit hook has been successfully implemented to ensure code quality before each commit. The hook runs automatically and takes ~5 seconds.

## What It Checks

1. **Python Syntax** - Validates core Python files for syntax errors
2. **Hardcoded Credentials** - Scans for hardcoded passwords (must use environment variables)
3. **Emoji Characters** - Warns if emojis are found (ASCII-only policy)
4. **Module Imports** - Verifies critical modules can be imported successfully

## Installation

For team members cloning the repository:

```bash
./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
```

This script:
- Copies hooks from `.githooks/` to `.git/hooks/`
- Makes them executable
- Tests them to ensure they work

## Usage

Once installed, the hook runs automatically:

```bash
git commit -m "Your message"

# Hook runs automatically:
# [1/4] Checking Python syntax...        [OK]
# [2/4] Checking for hardcoded credentials... [OK]
# [3/4] Checking for emoji characters... [WARNING]
# [4/4] Running critical module imports... [OK]
# [OK] ALL PRE-COMMIT CHECKS PASSED
```

## What Gets Blocked

The hook will **prevent commits** if it finds:
- Python syntax errors in core modules
- Hardcoded passwords in code
- Import errors in critical modules

The hook will **warn** (but not block) if it finds:
- Emoji characters in Python files (should use ASCII indicators instead)

## Files Created

```
.githooks/
  └── pre-commit                 # The actual hook script
scripts/
  └── setup-git-hooks.sh         # Installation script
docs/
  └── GIT_HOOKS.md               # Detailed documentation
```

## Benefits

1. **Catch Errors Early** - Find issues before they reach CI/CD
2. **Security** - Prevent accidental credential commits
3. **Code Quality** - Enforce standards automatically
4. **Fast** - Only ~5 seconds per commit
5. **Team Consistency** - Everyone runs the same checks

## Testing

The hook has been tested and verified working:
```bash
# Test 1: Hook installation
./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
# [OK] All checks passed

# Test 2: Real commit
git commit -m "Add pre-commit hook for code quality checks"
# [WARNING] Found emojis in demo files (expected, non-blocking)
# [OK] All critical checks passed
# [main 996cf67] Add pre-commit hook for code quality checks
```

## Bypassing the Hook

In rare emergency cases (not recommended):
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix"
```

## Next Steps

All team members should:
1. Run `./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh` after cloning
2. Review `docs/GIT_HOOKS.md` for detailed documentation
3. Use environment variables for all credentials
4. Use ASCII indicators (`[OK]`, `[ERROR]`) instead of emojis

**Status**: [IMPLEMENTED] and [TESTED]

**Ready for**: Team deployment and customer delivery

**Performance**: ~5 seconds per commit (fast enough to not disrupt workflow)
